    <h2>Project Description:</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We will be using data that includes age, weight, gender, and various vitals collected from 70,000 users to test our hypothesis on the correlation of lifestyle choices, blood indices, and body indicators. </p>
    <p>Looking specifically at:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Does alcohol consumption lead to greater risk of heart attack?</li>
        <li>Does smoking lead to greater risk of heart attack?</li>
        <li>Does being physically active negate certain other factors that increase risk of heart attack?</li>
        <li>Is one gender more prone to heart attack then the other?</li>
    </ol>
